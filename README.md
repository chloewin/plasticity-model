model for synaptic facilitation, depression

Communication in the brain takes place at synapses, tiny gaps between neurons. In these synapses, neurotransmitters are released from _presynaptic_ terminals to _postsynaptic_ structures in _vesicles_ (packets). Neurotransmitters mediate electric responses in the postsynaptic neuron. Synaptic activity often leads to changes in synaptic strength (how successful the presynaptic cell is at causing an electric response in the postsynaptic cell.) There are several forms of this. One is synaptic facilitation...synaptic depression...nt running out for depression and calcium build up for facilitation...
